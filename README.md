# Concert Ticket Analysis

## Introduction

Ed Sheeran's last concert sold within 5 min and was advertised on Viagogo for as high as 800€ soon after (vs (80€ initially). Concert prices can vary wildly depending on the type of event. For some really popular events, primary tickets are almost impossible to get a hold of. Ticket scalping is an industry in and of itself. 

Both big music fans, we aimed at cracking the code of the concert industry and set out to predict what concert would sell out. In front of the diversity of events and artists, we were convinced that data science could prove invaluable in approaching the problem. 

In this report, we outline our approach and our findings:
